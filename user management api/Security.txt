Node js - REST ful APIs 

Authentication and User Management (Practices)

1. Password Security 

signup -> name, email, age, password 

password -> 'passwordissecret' -> when stored exactly in the DB poses a threat 

solution -> Always Encrypt the password 'fidigidh.4o;y7t4p78hd;h94t97hf:$'6847y45gfigf9t'

package -> bcrypt (hashing the password)

if we try to decrypt an encrypted password using permutation and combination using the best computer in the world, it will take 16 years to decrypt this string 


2. API Security 

JWT token based authentication
