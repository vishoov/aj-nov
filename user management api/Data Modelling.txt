Problems:

1. we cannot check duplicacy of data
2. there are no regularalization of the data
3. data has no rules 

this leads to no uniformity meaning no practical use of data 

4. there is no privacy of the data 


Data Modelling

1. enforcing a schema to prevent data inconsistencies
2. we are making the data uniform
3. data integrity enhances 

Mongoose

ODM -> Object Data Modelling software that helps us in validation, regularalizing and encrypting the data 

distorted data                 uniform data 
abcbbcbabbabcbabbcba ----> aaaaabbbbbcccccc


Mongoose has inbuilt validators that help us in ensuring data integrity at the application level 

NOTE!!!! IT ALSO HELPS US IN CONNECTING TO THE DATABASE
