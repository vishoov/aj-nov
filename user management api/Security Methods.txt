1. Environment Variables 
web scrapers -> unsecured API keys -> payment 

implement env variables -> those variables that are hidden from hard coding in the project and are hidden in the .env file

package : dotenv

2. Input sanitization 

Threat: 
1. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) -> hackers send script to our servers that get executed
2. SQL/NoSQL Injections -> information -> query 

package: xss


3. Server Security -> allow only selected IP addresses to access our server 

package -> cors (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)


4. Rate Limiting -> DDoS Attacks -> Distributed Denial of Service 

ip address -> allow only limited number of requests from a specific client in a given time window 


package: express-rate-limit
