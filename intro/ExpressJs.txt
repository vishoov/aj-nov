ExpressJS

API Design

Expressjs is helping us in defining routes and their handler functions

app.method('/path', handlerFunction)

app = express instance
method = HTTP method 
path = the keyword that comes after the domain name 
handlerFunction = function that handles the working of a route 

express route also provides the information or data that has been recieved from the user
in the request as an object 
similarly whatever we need to respond with will also be treated as an object 

Req (request) -> information that we recieve with a request
