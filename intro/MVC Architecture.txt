MVC Architecture is a fundamental architexture pattern in software development that seperates and application into three interconnected components 
This pattern enables seperation of business logic, UI logic and input logic 

Model 
Route (View)
Controller

MVC -(Model-View-Controller)


1. Model -> Data and business logic

The model represents the data layer of the application. It manages the data, logic and rules of application independently of the ui 

Responsibility:

1. Manage the validation of the data
2. business logic 
3. Implements rules and regulation 


2. View - User interface and presentation 

the view handles everything users see and interact with directely that is ROUTES

it consists of all the routes and what paths do they have, what methods do they have

Responsibility
1. display the data to users
2. responds to user requests
3. takes the requests to the handler functions

3. Controller - Application logic and coordination 

logic where we handle the requests, where we write the handler functions for all the routes 


Benefitys of MVC Architecture

1. seperate of concerns
2. full Controller
3. MAIN - Scalability
