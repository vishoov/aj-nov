Databases -> are structured systems for storing, managing and retreiving data efficiently.

categorized based on how they store the data 
1. Relational (SQL Database)
2. Non-Relational (NoSQL Databases)


Relational DBs store the data in form of tables (rows and columns) Each table represents an entity (users, products, orders, reviews) which is related in terms of structure 

Non Relational DBs store the data in form of JSON like formats (BSON) Each document is independant and can be changed as per usage, there is no strict schema at the database level

this poses security issues -> for that we use Data modelling on the server level 


Aspect                  Relational                                  Non-Relational

Data Model             Tabled with fixed rows and columns           Collections containing JSON     
                                                                    like documents

Schema                  Predefined, rigid schema required           Schema-less, dynamic structure  
                        before data insertion                       allow data of varying fields

Relationships           JOINS (work on keys)                        No joins no keys etc

Query Lang              SQL (structured query language)             MongoDB Query Language (Javascript)


**Scalability           Vertical (increases the server              Horizontal Scaling - creates 
                        resources)                                  distributed data clusters 

Perfromance             excellent for complex queries               optimized for high                
                        slower for massive datasets                 speed querying and lesser complex   
                                                                    query capabilities

Use cases               Banking, finance, Taxation,                 real time analytics, IoT, content
                        ecommerce, data warehousing                 management, CRMs


Cost Effectiveness      Expensive                                   Cost effective 

Two ways of deploying a database 
1. local database 
2. cloud database 


MONGODB

document-oriented NoSQL database designed for scalability, flexibility, and high performance 


Architecture components

1. Document based data model -> storing the data in form of documents 
2. Data Organization Heirarchy 

Cluster -> is the physical location where the database is created 
Database -> Top Level container that stores multiple kinds of data that is associated with a particular project or product
Collections -> groups of related documents, similar to tables in SQL but without a fixed schema 
Document-> individual data record within collection that is stored in the form of json like document
Field-> individual data attribute (name, email, password)


features

1. Schema-less
2. Querying and indexing 

indexing means how fast we are able to fetch any data 

3. Aggregation Framework -> its a feature that allows complex data transformations and computations directly within mongoDB

10000 users-> count of male users that are based in different cities of country 


How to use mongodb?

1. MongoDB Shell -> CLI of mongodb that helps us in interacting with the database through code
2. MongoDB Compass -> a graphical user interface 
3. MongoDB Atlas -> cloud data deployment service
